A simple app to visualize maze generation algorithms. [App link](https://shouvikghosh2048.github.io/maze-generation-algorithms/)

The algorithms/visualizations come from this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) (especially the visualization for random DFS). The [LifeWiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page) was a useful resource for the automata example.
